You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"wizard","levels":3,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"WEKcnuQdnlwicaeL":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","iwLKAnJuuJS8n2Zy":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"oX9DbUxq17efCSSn":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"87B6Xy0bCdddGTau","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234283,"modifiedTime":1690589659404,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"}},{"_id":"WEKcnuQdnlwicaeL","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":3,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"CHgKiLd9fIUS9GAi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","W5XDvXmIRY1b5ZyU":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"mLx8saqD9ZOx3RsJ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","BS65CxNsdDJVkYIg":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Rp4p27R3ujrdzKPE":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"KXHSuKSeEO7gqf8a":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","NZK8uTlGGqDJo5na":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Q26NfMkxKy1eW6cK":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1690663766025,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"}},{"_id":"CHgKiLd9fIUS9GAi","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":5,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"nJyMWe5TuDAvvfLE":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","ZA0LCJhDIVjRsvCI":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"Rdg2Q7HOkDEUpQc9":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Heigy7DDCNgQ07SJ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","kAIkBu1covigBnXc":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"bRl5dVj80A4RMc2D":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","ZGIxdStVfOUkJpTG":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","TMZy9SOpIjXn0awf":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"O6W9gZUbrkQV18w0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1682123388765,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"nJyMWe5TuDAvvfLE","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. </p><h4>Tenets of Devotion</h4><p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p><p><strong>Honesty.</strong> Don't lie or cheat.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p><h1>Arcane Traditions</h1><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"wizard","levels":5,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lmNXdNBpHJg9dsPW":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","EtpWxuF3I4egW9s2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lSCzGB2kaRyrOor2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"87B6Xy0bCdddGTau","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234283,"modifiedTime":1682438465335,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"lmNXdNBpHJg9dsPW","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p><p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p><p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p><h3>Druids and the Gods</h3><p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.udVPA9JW5wy5t3G5]{Appendix B} include many such deities).

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"floor(@classes.druid.levels / 2)","units":"hour"},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":2,"max":"@classes.druid.levels > 19 ? 99 : 2","per":"sr","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Druid 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","advancementOrigin":"LJ71rwEncuo3IEit.qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm"}},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.2","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234433,"modifiedTime":1691425119582,"lastModifiedBy":"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ"}},{"_id":"uzzKZvUPB3Sb1fQv","name":"Druid Circle","ownership":{"default":0,"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Druid 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi","advancementOrigin":"LJ71rwEncuo3IEit.qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm"}},"img":"icons/magic/nature/tree-roots-glow-yellow.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.2","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234435,"modifiedTime":1691425119583,"lastModifiedBy":"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ"}},{"name":"Combat Wild Shape","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/wolf-shadow-black.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p><p>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Circle of the Moon","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3,"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ":3},"flags":{"rsr5e":{"quickDesc":{"value":true},"quickFooter":{"value":true}},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.7UsbSn36YDdF3IxF"},"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.additional-dnd5e-resources.features.r5ef8mEyBdwxHPzq","advancementOrigin":"OFtTiIqVxkpVYnXw.K0KVV0vIhd7W4VL7"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.2","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1690919311074,"modifiedTime":1691425119585,"lastModifiedBy":"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"jqs1nVoT4S3yEXnh"},{"name":"Circle Forms","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/ox-bull-horned-glowing-orange.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order.

druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.udVPA9JW5wy5t3G5]{Appendix B} include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"druid","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"3G57xrjK9433Ob4G":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","daycxFmZOuhzsD02":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"8eaYesz8OhaSRyhf":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","1m1anonvmPICQVl2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"cr","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR"},{"_id":"K8ShWezgK90dp1uk","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":2},"4":{"value":3},"10":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234284,"modifiedTime":1690929207839,"lastModifiedBy":"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ"}},{"_id":"3G57xrjK9433Ob4G","name":"Druidic","ownership":{"default":0,"3jibesMjwFYoUGNZ":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

Boon</h3><p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p><p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p><hr /><h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1><p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p><p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p><p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.WPFVBg589uI8iOMH]{The Fiend}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"warlock","levels":3,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":"Hit Points","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/hit-points.svg","_id":"JG49SkRWF9gsjjaz"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"KPzxu6ddt58ZPX9n":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.jTXHaK0vvT5DV3uO","KFOjcXi8GmPV6v2v":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.x6IJZwr6f0SGral7"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"CTXxqx6wWRDPJm3q"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8MlxM2nEfE3Q0EVk"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"vLj3fEFu3GLab0lv":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8MlxM2nEfE3Q0EVk"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"PpkmGUiRo0L2w9zJ"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.QwgfIpCN8VWfoUtX"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"a69r7WZKnzzNsFRn":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.QwgfIpCN8VWfoUtX"}},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"l35r7BpWacFCcB55"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.zB77V8BcCJvWVxck"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"Uv6gfpKlX7VuUIzV"},{"type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.0C04rwyvoknvFYiy"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/item-grant.svg","_id":"A4913hve41H0jMBI"},{"type":"ItemChoice","configuration":{"hint":"If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"wizard","levels":3,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"XXqRsMq6WQgsSEA7":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","86zoLsOGEVYB5i5N":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"pEuCNl6PW3wZphw4":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"87B6Xy0bCdddGTau","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234283,"modifiedTime":1690477782868,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"}},{"_id":"XXqRsMq6WQgsSEA7","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Permanent circle</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Associated object</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very familiar</td>\n<td>01-05</td>\n<td>06-13</td>\n<td>14-24</td>\n<td>25-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen casually</td>\n<td>01-33</td>\n<td>34-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viewed once</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False destination</td>\n<td>01-50</td>\n<td>51-100</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Familiarity</strong>. \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent Teleportation Circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's Secret tomb.</p><p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.</p><p>\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":"inst"},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":9,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":10,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"1d100","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":false,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV"}},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/runes-star-pentagon-magenta.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.0","coreVersion":"10.279","createdTime":1661787234119,"modifiedTime":1661791116204,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}},{"_id":"bllEWfm9xfEKynhv","name":"Mind Blank","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, Divination Spells, and the Charmed condition.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear}) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Cleric 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.v4gKwLhAq9vuqza7","advancementOrigin":"IzAhc6eH22vXGADA.x1zumbrnbhqlrrs6"}},"img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":300000,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1661787234436,"modifiedTime":1690667729268,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"}},{"_id":"1H58RHC2bT0nkw91","name":"Divine Domain","ownership":{"default":0,"1BFT9w6X3VZv5E64":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life.
