As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</p><p>If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</p><p>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p><h3>Elegant Maneuver</h3><p>Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.</p><h3>Master Duelist</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p></div></div></div></div><div><p></p></div><div><p></p></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer><div><p><br></p></div></footer>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.2","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1690759322430,"modifiedTime":1691171082614,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"},"_id":"KDyHjVRqxYVcLZsi"}

He and his wife were murdered by a rival, and Sutha's uncle took her in and raised her. She joined the city watch, motivated by her desire to find justice for her father, whose murderer is still at large.</p><p>Dwarf Cleric: @UUID[Actor.BaCJ0JGl5Zz8xFE6]{Tordek}</p><p>Tordek is a cleric who made a living brewing ale and presiding over weddings (and providing the refreshments for the receptions).</p><p>Drow Bard: @UUID[Actor.f4TVWwtyBWE41fKU]{Vadania}</p><p>Vadania performed in taverns across the city, and stopped quite a few brawls before they got serious. She kept an ear and eye open, and let the city watch know when she heard or saw something untoward in the offing.</p><p>Human Rogue: @UUID[Actor.oH7mkI2zyt2Seywa]{Ælfric}</p><p>Ælfric was a private investigator who was born in poverty but was adopted by a wealthy family who ran over his mother with their carriage when they were being pursued by a group of assassins.

These adventures can be dropped into an existing campaign where existing fifth-level characters are recruited into the squad, or you can create new characters at fifth level, or you can use the @UUID[.6whwN2ZZudLhtTxx]{sample characters.}</p><img src=\"modules/flying-squad/images/flying-squad-street.webp\" /><p><em>The Flying Squad name was inspired by the London police unit started in the 1920s.</em></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> to show images that appear in the journal (like the one above) to the players:</p><ul><li><p>Click the image.</p></li><li><p>A separate window will open.</p></li><li><p>Click the Show Players button in the title bar of the window.</p></li></ul><h2>Location</h2><p class=\"western\">Adventures will take place in and around the city; there will be no long-distance travel.</p><p class=\"western\">This means that players can come and go each week without having to worry about their characters having to travel 200 miles to catch up with the rest of the squad. The @UUID[Item.yv2YbVDxIIo7x4CS]{Amulet of Sending}<span style=\"font-style:normal\"> each investigator is provided with allows easy communication between party members, and the @UUID[Item.5aMlGUpGX3h0Xlc1]{Cloak of Flight} can quickly reunite them.</span></p><p class=\"western\">The exact city is left open to allow you to place the flying squad in any campaign. Waterdeep makes a good base of operations, but any large city in any world will do. Preferably it will be on the ocean near a large river.</p><h2>DMing Investigations</h2><p>The first rule is to have fun.</p><p><strong>Don't be stingy with clues. </strong>There should always be multiple clues that lead the squad to the suspect. If the players somehow miss them, use an NPC to point something out, or have Mindy, the Flying Squad's office manager, show up with the necessary information.</p><p><strong>Passive Checks:</strong> Having the players constantly rolling Perception and Investigation rolls can be immersion breaking. Instead, consider using passive Perception and Investigation checks for run-of-the mill checks. The passive value for each skill is listed in parentheses on the character sheet after the modifier.</p><p>The total for a passive check is:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\">10 + all modifiers that normally apply</p><p>For a 5th level character with Wisdom 14 and proficiency in Perception, this would be:</p><p style=\"text-align:center\">15 = 10 + 3 (proficiency bonus) + 2 (Wisdom bonus)</p><p>When a character's passive total exceeds the DC of the clue, just tell the player what they find.</p><p><strong>Keep the Ball Rolling:</strong> If you need to, fudge Perception and Investigation rolls.</p><p><strong>Let the Players Win:</strong> If the players have a good idea that isn't mentioned in these case notes, or you didn't think of, let them run with it.</p><p><strong>Kill or Capture: </strong>Some suspects are humanoid and should be captured and face justice in the court system, rather than killed outright. Some suspects are evil monsters and should be destroyed. In either case, full XP for defeating the creature should be awarded.</p><p>When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points <strong>by a melee attack</strong> the player can decide at that moment whether to knock the target out or kill them. See @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7.JournalEntryPage.ckTc3L0Byh2WMHsp#knocking-a-creature-out]{Knocking a Creature Out} in the D&amp;D rules under @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7.JournalEntryPage.njF9PueE9rmnn8N8]{The Order of Combat}. Note that ranged and spell damage cannot be mitigated this way.</p><p><strong>NPC Deaths: </strong>The squad's goal is to bring criminals to justice, rather than kill them. Therefore, when named humanoid NPCs are reduced to 0 hit points treat them as characters, giving them death saving throws each round until they stabilize or die. You many wish to do the same with some named monsters.</p><h2>Backup</h2><p>@UUID[Actor.r8BUf0tfWy6fAxqR]{Mindy} is the office manager, and as a half-elf is on duty 20 hours a day. The squad can call her for backup or @UUID[Actor.OdcDE5pocdHhPknm]{Broam Larkspur} pretty much any time with an @UUID[Item.yv2YbVDxIIo7x4CS]{Amulet of Sending} should they get in over their heads. Officers of the law aren't totally on their own and have every expectation that their fellow officers will help them out of a jam.

Broam Larkspur, is a meticulous paladin and stickler for the rule of law and humane treatment of suspects.</p><h2>Civil Forfeiture</h2><p class=\"initial\">Evidence, assets and equipment used in the commission of a crime are subject to forfeiture by the squad. These items are to be kept in the armory of the squad’s office pending the outcome of criminal proceedings. If perpetrators are found guilty in a court of law the forfeiture is permanent.</p><p class=\"western\">These items can be used by the squad in pursuit of their duties. Cash and valuables seized from suspects apprehended in the commission of a crime are to be deposited in the strongbox in the armory. These funds may be used for squad expenses; for example, to pay for the casting of spells to raise innocent bystanders who were killed as collateral damage during the apprehension of suspects.</p><h2>Use of Force</h2><p class=\"initial\">Squad members should use non-lethal means in pursuit of suspects if possible.  See @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7.JournalEntryPage.ckTc3L0Byh2WMHsp#knocking-a-creature-out]{Knocking a Creature Out} in the D&amp;D rules.</p><p class=\"initial\">Injury to bystanders and damage to civilian property should be avoided at all costs. See Unwritten Rule #1 below.</p><p class=\"western\">Medical and magical aid should be rendered to all injured humanoid suspects so that they may appear at trial.</p><h2>Use of Magic</h2><p class=\"initial\">Magic may not be used to coerce confessions from suspects. Spells such as <em>zone of truth</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> may be used to help determine the veracity of testimony.</span></p><p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Spells such as </span><em>charm person</em><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> and </span><em>suggestion </em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">may be used to gain the trust and cooperation from suspects, but charmed suspects cannot be held liable for any statements made or actions performed while under the effects of any mind control magic.</span></p><p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Officers may be held liable for the conduct of those under their mental control.</span></p><h2>Testimony and Trials</h2><p>If a case goes to trial officers may need to testify at court. Most cases do not result in a trial, as criminals who admit their guilt under <em>zone of truth </em>usually do not protest their innocence and instead cooperate with the authorities, turning on their co-conspirators to reduce their sentences.</p><p>See the @UUID[JournalEntry.aGzVXFlfaccwEFmo]{The Trial of Madrigal Mott} @UUID[Compendium.flying-squad.fs-adventure.wDLjtQFtCbeu2arN]{import} for an example of how a trial might be conducted.</p><h2>Search Warrants</h2><p>Technically speaking, the officers must obtain a search warrant from a magistrate if they wish to search a home or place of business. This is roundly ignored by both the city watch and the courts, but see @UUID[.1PlkGNzNSSY9ySZ2#unwritten-rule-#1:-the-rich-are-different]{Unwritten Rule #1: The Rich Are Different}.</p><h2>Accountability</h2><p>Investigators may be subjected to <em>zone of truth</em> while testifying in court. Deviation from department policies can range from temporary suspension, reduction in rank, loss of pay, dismissal, and in severe cases, prosecution and imprisonment upon conviction.</p><h2>Raising the Dead</h2><p>Department policy is, put bluntly, to \"let dead dogs lie.\" Victims are generally not raised from the dead. Officers are not supposed to pick and choose who lives and who dies.</p><p>However, at the discretion of the lieutenant, department funds (from civil forfeiture) can be used to raise the dead if their testimony is essential to making a case, and no relatives can be found who can foot the bill.</p><h2>Bounties and Rewards</h2><p>Bounties and rewards are offered for the capture of some wanted criminals and return of missing persons.

Care must be taken whenever dealing with them and when operating in their neighborhoods. If a case involves the wealthy or nobles policies must be strictly adhered to, otherwise the charges may be thrown out of court due to police or prosecutorial misconduct.</p><h2>Unwritten Rule #2: I Got Your Back</h2><p>The squad never leaves an officer behind. If a fellow officer goes down the first order of business is to get them back on their feet. See Rule #3.</p><h2>Unwritten Rule #3: One for You and One for Me</h2><p>Always carry two potions of healing. One for your fellow officer and one for yourself.</p><h2>Unwritten Rule #4: We Found It, It's Ours!</h2><p>The official policy is that weapons, armor and treasure belonging to criminals is subject to civil forfeiture. Translation: We found it, it's ours! However, if officers get too grabby and take something from the wrong person (i.e., a rich one), they're heading to prison.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":171875,"name":"Magic Items and Spells","type":"text","_id":"Zbmvo9Picz4hD5ZH","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>Magic Items</h2><p>The following magic items are available to the Flying Squad.

On a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check the officers notice blood on the cobbles near the door and on the door handle, as well as very large footprints in the grass.</p><p>The bandits are holding crossbows at the ready in area 1, while the bandit captain is shouting at the bursar in the vault area (4) to open the door.</p><p>The troll is trying to break down the door into the vault area, but it is <em>arcane locked</em>, requiring a DC 30 Strength check to break down. That means the troll can only succeed on a natural 20, since its Strength is only 18.</p><h1>Jailbreak</h1><p>A gang of thugs tries to break a buddy out of the holding cell while awaiting trial.</p><p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place the officers in area 14 of the courthouse.</p><p>Move the guards at area 7 and 7a into area 7b. Add the following villains into area 7:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Actor.ZQumiZE7uJgTJPcM]{Gang Leader}</p></li><li><p>Three @UUID[Actor.jnwVD8NuEksDHLQQ]{Gang Members}.</p></li><li><p>Place one @UUID[Actor.jnwVD8NuEksDHLQQ]{gang member}, who is awaiting trial, in an empty cell.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Encounter:</strong> The officers are in the office of the assistant prosecutor, Tanaquil, to get an arrest or search warrant. They hear shouting in the hall.</p><p>When the officers enter area 7 the gang leader has taken the holding cell keys from the guard and is unlocking the cell containing the gang member on trial.</p><h1>Burglary</h1><p>A gang of thieves tries to steal a magic item that has been placed in the evidence locker.</p><p><strong>Setup:</strong> Place the officers in area 13, Prosecutor Immerfroh's office.</p><p>Drag and drop the following actors into area 15, the Evidence Locker:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Actor.wW7NaiIFAoe6RcY3]{Mert}</p></li><li><p>Three @UUID[Actor.HHPlY7EANG0AllWK]{Thieves}</p></li></ul><p>Move the guard in 15 to the intersection of the corridors just south of the door to area 14.</p><p><strong>The Plot: </strong>The thieves have been hired to steal the Macalian Guffin, a bejeweled effigy of a bird that supposedly grants the bearer the ability to fly. It was captured by the City Watch from the lair of a master thief (@UUID[JournalEntry.d7LgQdmXcKDWDzix.JournalEntryPage.Ciw2OA06t4KicX9n]{Lavinia Shortbottom}) some years ago, but she escaped from jail and was never tried, so the recovered items have languished in the Evidence Locker.</p><p>The Locker is protected by the<span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.64D1gNZ4hx7SWG2x]{Forbiddance} spell</span>, preventing Mert from using his preferred method of burglary, <em>dimension door</em>. He has brought three gnome thieves along to expedite the search.</p><p>Mert picked the lock and cast <em>suggestion</em> on the guard, who got up and left. Mert's accomplices slammed the door and began the search for the Guffin.</p><p><strong>The Encounter:</strong> The squad is in the office of Prosecutor Immerfroh when they hear a man shout, \"Hey, how did you get in here?\" They hear a quieter, unintelligible intonation, and then they hear the first voice say, \"Yeah, I think I'll go for a long walk on a short pier. Thanks for the advice!\" Then a door slams and there are footfalls receding down the corridor.</p><p>All that happens in two rounds, catching the officers by surprise, leaving them little time to react. If they go into the hall immediately they see the guard from 15 at the T intersection to the south.</p><p>If they talk to the guard he explains that he is going down to the docks to take a long walk off a short pier. \"I haven't gone swimming in a long time, and my gnome friend thought today would be a great day for a dip in the ocean!\"</p><p>On a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check the squad hears the burglars ransacking the Evidence Locker for the Guffin. The lock is DC 20 to pick with thieves' tools and DC 22 to break down with a Strength check (rolled at <strong>advantage</strong> if two officers combine their strength). Or they can ask the guard for the key!</p><p>When the officers enter the room they find four gnomes furiously searching the chests on the shelves, wildly tossing items onto the floor. The <em>forbiddance</em> spell prevents entry by teleportation, but not exit. Mert tries to use <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.A4RsPuSvB9wFtz1j]{dimension door}</em> to escape to the tree behind the courthouse, leaving his cohorts holding the bag.</p><p>A spellcaster can try to prevent Mert from leaving by casting <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em> when he tries to <em>dimension door.</em> The thieves try to escape, fighting if they must, but when they lose half or more of their hit points they surrender.</p><p>If the officers have met Mert before (in @UUID[JournalEntry.mqcL1f4oS9Y4Uq4s]{The Case of the Counterfeit Coppers} @UUID[Compendium.flying-squad.fs-adventure.1NitxYHNUyJhAXLq]{import}) they should recognize him. The thieves have seen Mert around, but don't really know how to find him: he recruited them in the @UUID[JournalEntry.bMEVZLmHouwdVRM5]{Midnight Sun} @UUID[Compendium.flying-squad.fs-adventure.YaNdjeNE5RzC2czk]{import} tavern.</p><p>The Macalian Guffin is in fact in the evidence room, but it is, alas, not magical. It is worth 1,000 gp, however.</p><h1>Not Guilty!</h1><p>A villain that the squad had previously arrested kidnaps the grandchild of the magistrate to get exonerated!</p><p><strong>Setup: </strong>pick a particularly annoying villain that caused the squad a lot of trouble and put them in Area 1 with a @UUID[Actor.EjOGAtokxgbIkTX5]{barrister}.</p><p>Make the Coach with horse tile in front of the courthouse visible (click Tile Controls, click the coach tile and right click the tile and click the Toggle Visibility State icon).</p><p>Put a @UUID[Actor.dG4qzNOh1Njf4ZaY]{thug} in the driver's seat of the coach, and another @UUID[Actor.dG4qzNOh1Njf4ZaY]{thug} in the back of the coach with its Visibility State toggled. Finally, place a @UUID[Actor.yrUhjRxbVVuDWma6]{Child} with the second thug, with the Visibility state toggled.</p><p>If you want a tougher encounter, use a gang of the villain's original minions instead of the generic thugs.</p><p><strong>The Encounter:</strong> A criminal that the squad previously arrested walks out of the courthouse alongside a barrister as the squad approaches the front door of the courthouse. The criminal looks at them, laughs, and exclaims, \"Not guilty!\" with a huge guffaw. They walk to a coach waiting on the street.</p><p>A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the barrister is holding a child's doll. That should be enough to raise the officers' hackles, but if not, have them roll a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check to see if they can tell that the villain is up to something and requires further investigation. If the officers still don't bite, as the coach starts to pull away they hear the muffled screams of a child.</p><p>The officers should stop the coach, free the child and rearrest the villain, this time for kidnapping a child.</p><p>The child is the grandchild of the magistrate, @UUID[Actor.v7F7Xuutb5JtwJk6]{Cyrus Wren}. The thugs kidnapped the girl and gave her doll to the barrister. During the trial the barrister ostentatiously placed the doll on the table, making sure the magistrate saw it and realized what it was. The magistrate quickly found the villain not guilty, hoping that the criminals would release the kid unharmed.</p><p>The magistrate will be forever indebted to the squad for saving his granddaughter.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"sort":350000,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3,"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.2.2","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1683636757666,"modifiedTime":1691035273341,"lastModifiedBy":"iYhcliJUezyQtIm6"},"_id":"omHJShQ5LXmS7pU2"}
